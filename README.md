### Project ###
In this project, I was provided with a simple Flask app and tasked with modifying it to add routes, forms, and API integration to allow the user to provide a filepath to an .m4a file and receive a transcription through OpenAI.

### Getting Started ###
Clone this repository to your local machine.
This app is meant to be used with IDE like VSCode.
This app requires a valid OpenAI API key located in a .env file.

The program assumes that you have python3 and pip3 installed on your machine.
In the VSCode terminal window type the following:
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
In VSCode, press Cmd-Shift-P (on Mac) or Ctrl-Shift-P (on Windows).
   In the command selection text box, type "Python Create"
   From the options dropdown select "Python Create Environment"
   From the next options dropdown select "venv"
After the above and setting up the database, you should be able to run and debug this program

### Skill Development ###
Flask: Applied knowledge of Flask structure/usage to a practical setting.
CSS: Developed desired style and layout using style sheets.
RESTful APIs: Utilized OpenAI's API to get and post information in complex formats.
